## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Authentication + API integration)  
- **Database**: Supabase (Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL)  
- **AI/ML Models**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow) / Edge Functions  
- **APIs Integrated**:  
  - 🌦️ Weather API (OpenWeather/IMD)  
  - 🌱 Soil Data (SoilGrids / IoT Sensors)  
  - 📊 Market Prices (e-NAM, Agmarknet)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input** – Farmer enters soil type, pH, location, and irrigation details.  
2. **Processing** – Supabase stores data → AI model analyzes inputs + weather + soil data.  
3. **Output** – Farmer receives crop suggestions with:  
   - 📊 Suitability Score  
   - 🌾 Expected Yield  
   - 💰 Profit Estimate  
   - ✅ Benefits & ⚠ Risks  
4. **Decision Support** – Farmers can view detailed crop plans and market insights.
